## 🎯 Summary

### Attack Vectors Identified
1. IDOR in API
2. SQL Injection in Web APP
3. Phishing in Emails

### Key Findings
- Absence of account ownership validation in API (jwt token)
- No multi-factor authentication (MFA) enforcement
- Direct SQL query execution in web application
- WAF rule deficiency against MySQL versioned comments

### Top 3 Recommendations
